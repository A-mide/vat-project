    <p>Value-added taxes (VAT), which are a type of consumption tax, are major sources
         of revenue for countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), among other regions.</p>  
    <p> According to the Tax Foundation, VAT actually contributed to one-third of the OECD countries’ 
        tax revenue in 2019.<br>
     In contrast, the U.S. relies more heavily on property and individual income taxes, with only approximately 17.6% of revenue coming from consumption taxes., Here’s what you should know about the VAT. </p>

<strong><h2> How Can VAT Work?</h2></strong>
<p class="">The VAT is a <a href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/types-of-taxes">cosumption tax</a> because it’s based on, essentially, spending money rather than earning money. It is levied on services and goods at every stage of the supply chain.</p>
<p class="">The VAT taxation system is popular in many countries, but it’s more common in certain parts of the world. For example, all European countries levy a VAT, according to the<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/value-added-tax-2021-vat-rates-in-europe/"> Tax Foundation.</a> However, the U.S. does not have such a system in place. Instead, it uses local or state sales taxes.</p>
<p>When a company sells the raw materials for a product to a factory, the tax gets added. Similarly, a VAT gets added on each time the good or service gains value and trades hands. So from the factory to wholesaler, from wholesaler to retailer and from retailer to consumer the VAT is applied each step of the way.</p>
<p>VAT is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, suppose a consumer buys a good for $50 with a 10% VAT to the retailer. The consumer pays $55 total, and the retailer keeps $50 of it. The rest goes to the government.</p>
<p> It’s understandable for many people to think VAT and sales tax are the same thing. But the VAT system implements a tax at every level of production. So, everyone who engages in creating the product or service pays a VAT. In contrast, a sales tax only gets implemented at the last stage, when the consumer purchases the product.</p>
<br>
<h3>Special Considerations for Business Owners</h3>
<p>The VAT system likely leads to greater costs for business owners, and not just at the manufacturer or retailer level. It impacts every owner throughout the production chain. That’s because each level of production must calculate the required taxes at their stage in the chain. That results in more paperwork and accounting.</p>
<p>VAT can also be difficult for companies that work beyond a national scale. This is because global firms have to consider the tax regimes of every country that the supply chain runs through.</p>
<p> However, in countries that use it, businesses can generally reclaim VATs for tax-deductible business expenses where the tax.</p>

<br>
<P>You can calculate the VAT paid at each stage in the production of an item by subtracting the previously charged VAT from the most recent stage’s VAT.For example, Great Britain’s standard VAT rate is 20% for most goods and services. <br>Suppose there is a manufacturer of jewelry based in Great Britain. <br>The group needs to purchase the raw materials, like precious metals, from a dealer. As the seller in the exchange, the dealer charges the manufacturer $5, including the 20% VAT. The dealer collects the payment and sends the VAT amount to the government.</P>
